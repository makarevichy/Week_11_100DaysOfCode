# Week 11

### Days 72-73: July 30-31, Monday-Tuesday.

**Today's Progress**: Mice package, environments and conditions.

**Thoughts** 
- I worked with the missing data and methods of filling. I read the chapters of environments and conditions from the book Advanced R once again to get a deeper understanding of these topics.
